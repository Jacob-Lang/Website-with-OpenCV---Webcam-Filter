# Website-with-OpenCV---Webcam-Filter
 Using OpenCV to create custom webcam filter - hosted on a website!

Initially i just wanted to play with the webcam functionality of OpenCV in python. 
I wrote the webcam_filter.py script which runs my custom webcam filter. 

I then wanted to share my work on a webpage so decided to learn a bit of html and javascript. I rewrote the webcam filter using opencv.js (the JavaScript version of OpenCV) and embdedded it into a very basic website.

The website is hosted through GitHub pages and can be found here:

An example of the filtered image can be seen here:

As reference for the JavaScript part I learnt a lot from the tutorials provided here:
